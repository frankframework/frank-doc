## AngularJS frontend
* Mostly built with directives
* Directives can have templates
* almost no controllers (Main controller as an app shell)
* $scope is container for scoped variables

## Angular (upgrade notes)
* directives mostly to component logic for template support
* `$http.get("js/frankdoc.json")` in global app service
* hierarchy can be managed by parent <-> child component relationship (Check this further)
*
