  <!-- This is a valid configuration. This has been tested by temporarily referencing
       FrankConfig-strict.xsd. Here we do not reference a schema, because we will
       check it also against FrankConfig-compatibility.xsd. The test will
       refer to the schema, so this will not happen here.
