## Frank!Doc

Frank!Doc is a documentation generator for Frank!Framework. It generates documentation from the source code of your Frank!Framework application, including descriptions of the components, their properties, and how they are connected.

### Getting started
Import the project in IntelliJ as a maven project. Make sure to use Java 25 or higher.

### Code style
We use the code style of the Frank!Framework project. You can find the settings here:
* [IntelliJ](https://github.com/frankframework/frankframework/blob/master/Frank_Framework_CodeStyle%20IntelliJ.xml)
* [Eclipse](https://github.com/frankframework/frankframework/blob/master/Frank_Framework_CodeStyle%20Eclipse.xml)

You can import these settings into your IDE to ensure that your code follows the same style as the rest of the project.
